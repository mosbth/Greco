1. Greco, Download

Greco is on GitHub.


Dowload it and point browser to index.php. That should be enough.

An example of a pure standard installation of greco is available here.

2. Greco, A small template for websites

From time to time I need to quickly create small websites. An example of this is the irc-log that
was created to ease for students to see what happens in an irc-channel.

  http://tekcp554.tek.bth.se/irc/

The main function of the site is to execute the unix-command "tail -100 irc.log". Still, I need a
bunch of webpages to make it look nice, stylish and usable.

Thats why.


3. Greco lives?

Greco is used in courses I conduct at Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden. It lives as long 
as its useful. No need for eternal life.

The course-blog is available here (pure swedish, use google translate...).

  http://db-o-webb.blogspot.com/

The course has a irc-channel. I'm in there.

4. Greco, The name

It must have a namn. I already use Persia for a more complete webtemplate so it got to be Greco.

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars

Basically because its always a war between Greco and Persia on what funktionality should be in the 
more complete Persia and the lighter variant of a webtemplate, Greco.


5. Greco, The license

Free software. No warranty.


6. Greco, The attitude

One must have attitude. Or a philosophy. Perhaps like this?

That works for now.

Enjoy.
